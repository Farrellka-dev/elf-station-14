  Descendants of mankind, the Aegi now reside on planet Elithia.
  They lead the Elithian Alliance - an interstellar federation of alien nations - and make for incredible diplomats, engineers and scientists.

  ## Biology

  The Aegi are a species of humanoids descended from the Humans of Earth. They appear largely similar to Humans, but have a few key differences.

  They take [color=#1e90ff]10% less Cold damage and 5% less Heat damage[/color], but [color=#ffa500]the tubular structure of bones and thin skin increases 5% Blunt damage and 5% Pearcing damage[/color].

  Improved muscles, as well as increased oxygen consumption, [color=#1e90ff]allow them to move 5% faster, and they also have 20% more stamina[/color].

  Due to the special structure of petal lungs, [color=#ffa500]they require much more oxygen than ordinary races[/color], however, [color=#1e90ff]with an excess of oxygen in the atmosphere, the body is saturated many times faster[/color].

  All Aeginian races feature larger ears with pointier tips. The length of the ears is one of the most identifying features of the various races.
  The ears are also more mobile than those of Humans: they can be raised, lowered, and pointed in a specific direction to better locate sounds. The pointed shape of the ears was a side-effect of these changes, and was never intentional.
  Many found it fitting, however, and no efforts were ever made to eliminate this side-effect.
